# BIOL406-2025-Final-Project
Tsuga't to be kidding me

This project set out to analyze zoochorous dispersal of non-native plant species along high and low use trails in Pacific Spirit Park. Transects were laid out along two trails, one with relatively high traffic, and one with relatively low traffic. Percent cover of non-native species was recorded at various quadrats along each transect. Relative traffic was determined using Strava Heat Map. Differences in percent cover for each species, and species richness in each quadrat, were analyzed using a paired t-test between each transect. Multivariate linear models with soil moisture, canopy cover, temperature, and aspect acting as potential random effects will also be used.

1) Data_Collection - Sheet1.csv = data collected from two trails, data collected under the 'high' traffic category were collected from Sasamat trail in Pacific Spirit Park, data collected under the 'low' traffic category was collected from Top Trail from PSP.

QuadratID = Specific quadrat where data was collected Ranges from H1-10, L1-10
