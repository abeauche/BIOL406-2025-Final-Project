# BIOL406-2025-Final-Project
Tsuga't to be kidding me

This project set out to analyze zoochorous dispersal of non-native plant species along high and low use trails in Pacific Spirit Park. Transects were laid out along two trails, one with relatively high traffic, and one with relatively low traffic. Percent cover of non-native species was recorded at various quadrats along each transect. Relative traffic was determined using Strava Heat Map. Differences in percent cover for each species, and species richness in each quadrat, were analyzed using a paired t-test between each transect. Multivariate linear models with soil moisture, canopy cover, temperature, and aspect acting as potential random effects will also be used.
