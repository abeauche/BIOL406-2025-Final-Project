# ===Analysis

# First check histograms of each variable to view distribution

# Scale variables (mutate(variable_scaled = scale(variable)))

#Check for correlations cor(dataframe) or cor(c("varable_1_scaled","variable_2_scaled",...))

#Make models and analysis of scaled variables (DO NOT SCALE RESPONSE)

# Thinking a t test between trails as well as an ANCOVA of response over distance for each trail.
